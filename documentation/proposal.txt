Research Vision
My research advances reliable, portable, and secure IoT systems spanning the edge–cloud
continuum. I focus on (i) heterogeneous deployment across CPUs/GPUs and multiple
ISAs, (ii) lightweight runtimes (e.g., WebAssembly) for safe, near-native execution at the
edge, and (iii) automation for orchestration, observability, and resilience in dynamic, resourceconstrained environments. At the HET Systems Centre, I will develop automation-by-design
methods to make IoT stacks easier to deploy, verify, and adapt in real-world settings such as
energy, mobility, and agriculture.

Track Record and Experience
• Edge/Cloud portability
University of Luxembourg (SnT), ACE5G (FNR) with Proximus. I designed cross-architecture
containerization workflows and evaluated WebAssembly (Wasm) and multi-arch containers on x86 64 and ARM64 (NVIDIA Jetson) targets. I investigated GPU acceleration, task throughput, and memory footprint, and built reproducible pipelines with
containerd, k3s, and runwasi.
• Automation and orchestration
Built end-to-end CI-driven experiments for cold/cached startup, image pull time, and
execution latency, enabling policy-based scheduling (e.g., energy-, latency-, or trustaware placement) across heterogeneous nodes.
• IoT offloading and mobility
Proposed mobility-aware task offloading strategies in fog/edge systems (vehicular
scenarios), reducing unnecessary service migrations while meeting latency budgets.
• Applied IoT prototyping
Delivered an IoT lighting system integrating sensors, cloud backends, and Android
monitoring with real-time fault detection.

Intended Work at HET: Position 2 (IoT & Automation)
I propose a three-year research line (initial one-year plan below) to build an Automation
Fabric for Heterogeneous IoT (AutoHetIoT), a set of methods and open tooling to simplify
secure deployment, runtime adaptation, and trustworthy operation of IoT applications across
edge and cloud.

Year 1 Objectives (1-year fixed term)
1. Portable Edge Runtime Toolkit: Hardened Wasm-based edge runtime profiles for ARM64
and RISC-V with capability-oriented sandboxes, deterministic resource quotas, and zerodowntime hot-swapping.
2. Automation Policies & Scheduling: Constraint-aware placement (latency, energy, carbon intensity, data locality) for containerd/k3s, with explainable decisions and fallbacks
for degraded networks.

3. Resilience & Observability: Lightweight SLO guards (latency/throughput/ML inference accuracy) and self-healing actions (restart, migrate, scale-to-zero) driven by online
telemetry.
4. Security-by-Design: Supply-chain attestations (SBOMs), signed artifacts, and per-node
trust policies to automate secure upgrades and rollbacks.

Methodology
• Experiment Platforms: AWS bare metal and on-prem ARM64 clusters (e.g., NVIDIA
Jetson), with synthetic (TPC-like) and domain traces (mobility/energy).
• Runtimes: containerd, k3s, runwasi/Wasm, and GPU offloading where appropriate.
• Metrics: Startup/latency SLOs, energy per task, memory footprint, service availability,
upgrade MTTR/MTBF.
• Reproducibility: Open repositories, containerized pipelines, and artifact evaluation
scripts.

Use-Case Pilots (co-designed with HET partners)
• Smart Mobility: On-vehicle and roadside edge nodes running Wasm microservices for
perception pre-processing and incident detection, with live migration under handovers.
• Energy Microgrids: Forecasting/control loops at the edge with constraint-aware placement to reduce peak loads; verifiable firmware-style updates via Wasm.
• Digital Agriculture: Sensor fusion and anomaly detection with intermittent connectivity; local-first analytics and privacy-preserving aggregation.

Contribution to the HET Centre
• Interdisciplinarity: Co-develop datasets and pilots with colleagues in CPS security, data
science, and digital twins; provide the automation layer consumed by these workstreams.
• Funding & Networks: Contribute to Horizon Europe / COST / EIC proposals (IoT,
Edge AI, trustworthy computing); leverage ongoing industry links (telecom, mobility,
energy).
• Education: Develop a Portable IoT Systems module and supervise student projects
aligned with Centre pilots; promote open, reproducible practices.

12–18 Month Milestones
• Open-source AutoHetIoT toolkit (runtime profiles + policy engine + SLO guards).
• Two pilot demonstrators (mobility, energy) with quantified SLO/energy improvements.
• Co-authored funding proposals and joint publications with HET collaborators.
