## Executive Summary

I propose developing **ResilientEdge**, an adaptive IoT orchestration framework that addresses a critical gap in current IoT systems: their inability to dynamically adapt automation policies when network conditions degrade, resources become constrained, or security threats emerge. This research directly aligns with HET Centre's focus on human-environment-technology systems integration and addresses real-world challenges in critical infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Static IoT Systems**: Most IoT deployments use fixed automation policies that cannot adapt to changing conditions
- **Reactive Approach**: Systems only respond after problems occur, leading to service degradation or failures
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Conservative policies waste energy and computational resources during normal operations
- **Security Gaps**: Security policies are often static, making systems vulnerable to evolving threats

### Real-World Impact
- **Energy Grids**: Cannot adapt to peak demand or network failures, leading to blackouts
- **Smart Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles lose functionality during network handovers
- **Smart Cities**: Traffic management systems fail during infrastructure degradation
- **Industrial IoT**: Manufacturing processes stop when network conditions change

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
Develop an adaptive IoT orchestration system that automatically reconfigures automation policies in real-time while maintaining critical service guarantees.

### Specific Objectives (Year 1)
1. **Design Multi-Policy Framework**: Create latency-optimized, energy-efficient, security-focused, and degraded-mode policies
2. **Implement Predictive Adaptation**: Develop ML algorithms to predict system degradation and preemptively adjust policies
3. **Build Zero-Downtime Reconfiguration**: Use WebAssembly hot-swapping for seamless policy transitions
4. **Validate with Real-World Pilots**: Deploy and test with energy grid and smart mobility scenarios

## Technical Approach

### 1. Multi-Policy Framework
```python
# Policy Types and Their Characteristics
LATENCY_OPTIMIZED = {
    "max_latency": 20ms,
    "energy_budget": 100W,
    "priority": ["speed", "throughput", "energy"]
}

ENERGY_EFFICIENT = {
    "max_latency": 100ms,
    "energy_budget": 50W,
    "priority": ["energy", "latency", "throughput"]
}

SECURITY_FOCUSED = {
    "max_latency": 150ms,
    "security_level": "high",
    "priority": ["security", "latency", "throughput"]
}
```

### 2. Predictive Adaptation Algorithm
- **Input Features**: Network latency, bandwidth, CPU usage, memory usage, security threat level, energy consumption
- **ML Model**: Lightweight neural network for degradation prediction
- **Decision Logic**: Policy selection based on predicted conditions and current constraints
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Fallback policies and service guarantee validation

### 3. WebAssembly Hot-Swapping
- **Runtime Isolation**: Each policy runs in isolated WebAssembly sandbox
- **State Migration**: Seamless transfer of application state between policies
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation and deallocation of compute resources
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback to previous policy if adaptation fails

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Framework Development (Months 1-6)
