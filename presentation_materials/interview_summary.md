## 🤔 **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

### **Q: "How is this different from existing orchestration systems?"**
**A**: "Existing systems like Kubernetes use static policies. ResilientEdge introduces dynamic policy adaptation with predictive capabilities. We use WebAssembly for zero-downtime reconfiguration, which is novel in IoT contexts. Our ML-based prediction allows proactive rather than reactive adaptation."

### **Q: "What are the main technical challenges?"**
**A**: "Three key challenges: (1) Ensuring policy transitions don't violate service guarantees, (2) Developing accurate prediction models with limited training data, and (3) Optimizing WebAssembly runtime for resource-constrained IoT devices. I have preliminary solutions for each."

### **Q: "How will this contribute to HET Centre's goals?"**
**A**: "ResilientEdge provides the automation foundation that other HET research areas can build upon. It enables resilient smart cities, adaptive energy systems, and secure critical infrastructure - all core HET themes. It also opens new funding opportunities in Horizon Europe IoT and Edge AI programs."

### **Q: "What's your timeline for implementation?"**
**A**: "Year 1: Core framework and one pilot (energy grid). Year 2: Second pilot (smart mobility) and ML optimization. Year 3: Industry deployment and standardization efforts. Each phase produces publications and funding proposals."

### **Q: "How do you ensure system safety during policy transitions?"**
**A**: "We implement multiple safety mechanisms: (1) Service guarantee validation before transitions, (2) Rollback capability if adaptation fails, (3) Gradual policy migration to minimize disruption, and (4) Comprehensive testing with fault injection."
