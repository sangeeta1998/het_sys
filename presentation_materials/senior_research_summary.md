This work is the first to create a comprehensive framework that integrates lattice-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption, quantum ML, and zero-knowledge proofs specifically for IoT orchestration. We address the unique challenges of resource-constrained devices, real-time adaptation, and privacy-preserving coordination that don't exist in traditional post-quantum cryptography research."

### **Q: "What are the main technical challenges in implementing this system?"**
**A**: "Three key challenges: (1) Optimizing lattice-based cryptography for resource-constrained IoT devices, (2) Designing efficient homomorphic encryption schemes for IoT data types, and (3) Creating practical quantum-enhanced ML models that work with classical IoT hardware. I have preliminary solutions for each, including hardware acceleration and hybrid quantum-classical approaches."

### **Q: "How will this contribute to the HET Centre's research goals?"**
**A**: "This research positions HET Centre as a global leader in quantum-safe critical infrastructure. It creates new interdisciplinary research opportunities, attracts industry partnerships with quantum computing companies, and opens major funding opportunities in Horizon Europe quantum programs. The work directly addresses HET's focus on human-environment-technology systems by securing the technological foundation of smart cities, energy grids, and transportation systems."
