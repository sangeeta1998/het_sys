## Abstract

This research addresses a critical gap in current IoT orchestration systems: their inability to adapt to dynamic network conditions, leading to service degradation, energy waste, and system failures. We propose a novel Adaptive IoT Orchestration Framework that uses reinforcement learning to continuously adapt system behavior based on real-time network conditions, device capabilities, and application requirements. This research directly contributes to HET Centre's mission by creating IoT systems that adapt to environmental changes while maintaining human-centric service quality.

## 1. Research Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Core Problem

**Current IoT orchestration systems fail when network conditions change unpredictably.** This is particularly critical in industrial environments where:

- **Network conditions vary** due to interference, mobility, and dynamic load patterns
- **Device capabilities differ** significantly across the IoT ecosystem
- **Application requirements change** based on real-time demands
- **Environmental factors** (interference, weather, obstacles) affect communication

### 1.2 Specific Research Question

**"How can we design IoT orchestration systems that automatically adapt their behavior to maintain optimal performance under dynamic network conditions while considering device constraints and application requirements?"**

### 1.3 Why This Matters

- **Industrial IoT**: Manufacturing systems lose efficiency when network conditions degrade
- **Smart Cities**: Urban IoT systems fail during peak usage or interference
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Energy grids, transportation systems need resilient IoT
- **Environmental Monitoring**: IoT sensors in remote areas face unpredictable conditions
