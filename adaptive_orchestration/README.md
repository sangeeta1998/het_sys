- Automatically switch between 5 adaptation strategies
- Optimize performance while maintaining service quality

## 🔬 How the System Works

### **1. Real-Time Network Assessment**
The system continuously monitors:
- Network latency, bandwidth, packet loss
- Signal strength and interference levels
- Congestion and environmental factors

### **2. Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)**
```python
# Q-Table structure for learning optimal strategies
State Space: Network condition + System load + Energy level
Action Space: 5 adaptation strategies
Reward Function: Performance improvements + Service quality
Learning Algorithm: Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
```

### **3. Five Adaptation Strategies**
- **🚀 Latency-Optimized**: Prioritize low-latency communication
- **🔋 Energy-Efficient**: Minimize energy consumption
- **🛡️ Reliability-Focused**: Maximize system reliability
- **⚖️ Hybrid-Adaptive**: Balanced optimization
- **🚨 Emergency-Mode**: Basic functionality during critical conditions

### **4. Performance Optimization**
- Maintains service quality while optimizing energy
- Reduces latency and improves reliability
- Learns from past experiences to make better decisions
- Adapts to changing network conditions automatically
